# data_analytics_2100

Repo documenting the programs I write for my IST 2510 class.

## Installation

I've tried to track all necessary libraries. Install with:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Good to Know

- For any of the datasets I use I will only be tracking the zipped file for github.
- The contents are unnecessary to have unzipped.
