# data_analytics_2510

Repo documenting the programs I write for my IST 2510 class.

## Installation

I would recommend keeping a python venv active for testing with these datasets and libraries.

Here's how to create one assuming you have python installed and the ability to run scripts on your machine.

From the home directory of this repo run:

- `python -m venv venv`

For Windows:

- `.\venv\Scripts\activate`

Linux: 

- `source venv/bin/activate`

This might differ for weird distros...

Deactivate venv:

- `deactivate`

Once you've activated your venv, I've tried to track all necessary libraries. Install with:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Good to Know

- For any of the datasets I use I will only be tracking the zipped file for github.
